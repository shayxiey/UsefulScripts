maf2fasta.py is used to convert maf into fasta format. Single thread.

auto_paml.py is used to run PAML on slurm, only support codeml function now.
LRT_test.py, write_ctl.py are dlcs that used to support running auto_paml.py, 
former is to run likely ratio test, the other is to write ctls for auto_paml (not PAML!!!) 

sbatch-submit.py is written by Gao Rongsheng, edited by me. Used to submit shells to slurm.

Just enjoy my rough codes :)
